# Healthcare Application Presentation Layer Fixes

## Issues Fixed

1. **Namespace Inconsistencies**:
   - Fixed inconsistent namespaces in service interfaces (`Services.Abstractions` vs `Core.Services.Abstractions`).
   - Updated controllers to use the correct namespace imports.

2. **Reference Issues**:
   - Added references to required projects in the Presentation.csproj file.
   - Converted from PackageReference to FrameworkReference for ASP.NET Core.

3. **ClaimsPrincipalExtensions**:
   - Fixed `GetUserId` method to handle string IDs.
   - Corrected infinite recursion in the `IsInRole` method.

4. **Build Error Suppression**:
   - Added `NoWarn` flags to suppress non-critical warnings during development.

5. **Type Conversion Issues**:
   - Fixed type conversion in DoctorClinicController where string parameters needed to be parsed to Guid.
   - Added proper error handling for invalid Guid formats.

## Outstanding Issues

1. **Method Signature Mismatches**:
   - Several controllers call methods that don't exist in the service interfaces or have different signatures.
   - Need to update either the controllers or service interfaces to align method signatures.

2. **DTO Property Type Mismatches**:
   - Some DTOs have property types that don't match the expected types in the service methods.

3. **Commented-out Controllers**:
   - The following controllers still need to be fixed and uncommented:
     - MedicalRecordsController.cs
     - PetsController.cs
     - PetProfilesController.cs
     - RatingsController.cs
     - ClinicsController.cs
     - DoctorClinicController.cs

## Next Steps

1. Review service interfaces to ensure they provide all needed methods.
2. Update DTOs to have consistent property types across the application.
3. Fix and uncomment the temporarily disabled controllers.
4. Add proper API documentation using Swagger/OpenAPI.
